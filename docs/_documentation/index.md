**pymalts2** is a **Python** package for performing *matching* for *observational causal inference* on datasets containing continuous, categorical, or mixed covariates. It uses exact matching for discrete variables and learns generalized Mahalanobis distances for continuous variables. Instead of a predetermined distance metric, the covariates contributing more towards predicting the outcome are given higher weights.
